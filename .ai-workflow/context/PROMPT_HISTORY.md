## Task: Redesign Easy CV Wizard - Contained Chat + Paper-Sized Resume Preview + Interactive Sections

### Context
The user wants to improve the UX of the Easy CV Builder feature (`src/components/EasyCvWizard.js`). Currently:
- The feature takes the entire screen (`minHeight: "100vh"`)
- The Live Resume Preview is one continuous scrollable page
- Resume sections are not interactive

### Requirements

#### 1. Contained Chat Window Popup
- Convert the full-screen layout to a **floating modal/drawer** that feels like a chat widget popup
- Should NOT take full screen - more like 70-80% height, centered or anchored to bottom-right
- Add a minimize/expand toggle
- Keep the existing split layout (chat left, preview right) but in a contained modal
- Use MUI `Dialog` or custom `Drawer` with max dimensions

#### 2. Paper-Sized Resume Preview
- Transform the `LiveResumePreview` component to look like actual printer paper (8.5" x 11" aspect ratio)
- Add subtle shadow/border to simulate paper edges
- Use a white background with proper margins (like 0.5-1 inch equivalent)
- If content overflows, show multiple "pages" stacked vertically with page breaks
- Add page numbers at the bottom of each page
- Consider a zoom control (75%, 100%, fit-to-width)

#### 3. Interactive Resume Sections (Click to Edit)
- Make each section of the resume preview **clickable**
- When a user clicks a filled section (e.g., their name, phone, work history item):
  - Show a small tooltip/popover with options: "Edit", "Delete", "Move Up/Down"
  - If "Edit" is selected, the chatbot should ask: "What would you like to change about [section name]?"
  - Push a new message to the chat history and set `interventionMode` to handle the edit flow
- Add visual feedback: hover state with highlight, cursor pointer
- Track which section is being edited in state

### Constraints
- Follow existing MUI v7 patterns (see other components in src/components/)
- Keep the dark theme (#121212 background, #1e1e1e cards)
- Maintain mobile responsiveness (hide preview on xs, show full chat)
- No console.log statements
- Reuse existing state management (answers, history, setHistory)
- Keep the FLOW_STEPS configuration approach

### Files to Modify
- `src/components/EasyCvWizard.js` - Main component refactor

### Technical Notes
- Current layout uses `Box` with flex, 100vh height
- `LiveResumePreview` is an internal component at line ~125
- Chat messages render from `history` array
- Paper size: Use sx={{ width: 612, height: 792 }} for 8.5x11 at 72 DPI, or use aspect-ratio CSS
- For clickable sections, wrap each preview section in a clickable Box with onClick handler

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Easy CV opens as a floating popup, not full page
2. Resume preview looks like a stack of printer paper pages
3. Clicking any filled section triggers an "Edit/Delete" menu
4. Selecting "Edit" sends a message to the chat asking what to change
5. Mobile still works (chat only, no preview)

## Follow-up Task: EasyCv Overlay Architecture

### Problem
When the Easy CV chat is minimized, it shows a black screen because the wizard is rendered as a separate route (/easy-cv).

### Solution
Convert EasyCvWizard to work as an **overlay** that renders on top of the landing page.

### Requirements

#### 1. Render LandingPage as background
- Import LandingPage into EasyCvWizard
- Render LandingPage behind the modal/drawer
- When minimized, the landing page is fully visible and interactive
- When expanded, the chat overlay is on top with a backdrop

#### 2. State sync
- Minimized state should show full landing page (user can interact with it)
- Expanded state shows the chat popup overlaying the landing page
- Add a subtle backdrop when chat is open

#### 3. Minimized FAB button
- When minimized, show a floating action button (FAB) to re-open the chat
- Position bottom-right corner
- Use the sparkle/AI icon
- Add a subtle animation or pulse effect

### Implementation

In EasyCvWizard.js:
```jsx
import LandingPage from './LandingPage.js';
import Fab from '@mui/material/Fab';

// Add state
const [isMinimized, setIsMinimized] = useState(false);

// In render:
return (
  <>
    {/* Landing page always renders behind */}
    <LandingPage />
    
    {/* Backdrop when chat is open */}
    {!isMinimized && (
      <Box sx={{
        position: 'fixed',
        top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0,
        bgcolor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)',
        zIndex: 1200
      }} />
    )}
    
    {/* Chat popup - existing modal */}
    {!isMinimized && (
      <Box sx={{
        position: 'fixed',
        zIndex: 1201,
        // ... existing modal positioning
      }}>
        {/* Existing modal content */}
      </Box>
    )}
    
    {/* Minimized FAB button */}
    {isMinimized && (
      <Fab 
        color="secondary"
        onClick={() => setIsMinimized(false)}
        sx={{
          position: 'fixed',
          bottom: 24,
          right: 24,
          zIndex: 1200,
          animation: 'pulse 2s infinite'
        }}
      >
        <AiIcon />
      </Fab>
    )}
  </>
);
```

### Files to Modify
- src/components/EasyCvWizard.js

### Acceptance Criteria
1. When minimized, the full landing page is visible and usable
2. When expanded, the chat overlays the landing page with a backdrop
3. Clicking the minimize button shows the landing page
4. The Easy CV FAB button appears when minimized to re-open the chat

### Solution
Import LandingPage into EasyCvWizard and render it behind the modal. When minimized, the landing page should be fully visible and interactive. When expanded, the chat overlays with a backdrop. Add a FAB in bottom-right corner when minimized to re-open.

1. Add import at top:
import LandingPage from './LandingPage.js';

2. Wrap the return in a fragment and render LandingPage first:
- Render <LandingPage /> as first child
- Keep existing modal content, add zIndex 1201
- Add Fab component when isMinimized with position fixed bottom-right, onClick to setIsMinimized(false)

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Minimized = full landing page visible and interactive
2. Expanded = chat overlays landing page with backdrop  
3. FAB appears when minimized to re-open chat

## Task: Remove Mandatory Onboarding - Let Users Explore Freely

### Context
Currently, new users are forced to complete OnboardingPage before accessing the app. The user wants to remove this gate so users can explore the platform freely without completing onboarding first.

### Requirements
1. **Remove the onboarding redirect logic** in src/App.js:
   - In LandingPageRoute: Remove the redirect to /onboarding when onboardingCompleted === false
   - Logged-in users should go directly to /dashboard regardless of onboarding status

2. **Keep the /onboarding route accessible** (optional path, not mandatory):
   - Users can still visit /onboarding if they choose to
   - Remove the OnboardingRoute wrapper that enforces the gate

3. **Update AuthContext if needed**:
   - The onboardingCompleted flag can remain for tracking, but should not block access

4. **Do NOT delete the OnboardingPage component file yet** - just remove the mandatory redirect

### Files to Modify
- src/App.js - Remove onboarding gate logic in LandingPageRoute and simplify /onboarding route

### Constraints
- Keep existing authentication checks (user must be logged in for protected routes)
- Maintain backward compatibility - dont break existing user sessions
