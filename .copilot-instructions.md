# GitHub Copilot Chat Instructions

> **This file is automatically read by GitHub Copilot Chat at the start of every conversation.**

## 📋 Auto-Injected Context

When you start a new chat, you automatically have access to:

### Project Files (Always Available)
- `.ai-instructions.md` - Complete coding standards, conventions, and patterns for this project
- `.prompt-priming-template.md` - Session templates and quick prompts
- This file (`.copilot-instructions.md`) - Chat initialization instructions

### What You Know
✅ **Project Structure** - Architecture, directory layout, key files  
✅ **Tech Stack** - React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Firebase Auth, Gemini AI  
✅ **Coding Conventions** - From `.ai-instructions.md` (naming, patterns, MUI usage)  
- **Testing Approach** - Manual testing tracker + Playwright E2E + Test recording
✅ **Common Commands** - npm scripts, deployment, git workflow  
✅ **Recent Work** - Latest changes and known issues  

---

## 🎯 How to Use This Setup

### Starting a New Conversation
**You don't need to explain the project!** Just ask your question or state your task:

**✅ Good:**
- "Fix the authentication redirect bug"
- "Add a filter by date to resume history"
- "Optimize the database query in resume controller"
- "Write E2E test for profile update"

**❌ Not Needed:**
- "I'm working on a React project that uses..." _(I already know)_
- "This project uses MUI, please follow..." _(Already configured)_
- "The file structure is..." _(Already aware)_

### For Complex Tasks
If you need to provide additional session-specific context:
```markdown
**Current Task:** [brief description]
**Focus:** [specific files or areas]
**Constraints:** [any limitations]
```

## 🔧 Behavior Guidelines

### Code Generation
- **Follow `.ai-instructions.md` standards automatically**
- Use MUI `sx` prop for styling (no inline styles)
- Functional components with hooks only
- Proper error handling with try-catch
- Include loading states and user feedback

### File Operations
- **Always check current file contents before editing**
- Use `multi_replace_string_in_file` for multiple edits
- Include 3-5 lines of context in replacements
- Make executable scripts with proper shebangs

### Testing
- Use Playwright for E2E tests with page object model patterns
- Use tools/test-tracker.html for manual testing with progress tracking
- Record interactions with scripts/record-test.sh for future automation
- Include both positive and negative test cases

### Communication
- Be concise - skip unnecessary preambles
- Show code changes directly
- Explain "why" for complex decisions
- Confirm completion briefly
