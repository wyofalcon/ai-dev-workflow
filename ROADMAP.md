**Last Updated**: 2025-02-02
**Session Owner**: ashley.caban.c@gmail.com + wyofalcon@gmail.com
**Next Review**: After completing Week 1 (Day 7)

---

### **Session 4 (2025-11-02) - Week 2 Frontend Auth Complete (90% Complete)**

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ **Firebase SDK Integration**:
  - Installed firebase@12.5.0 and axios@1.13.1
  - Created Firebase config ([src/firebase/config.js](src/firebase/config.js))
  - Initialized Firebase Auth with project credentials

---

### **Session 5 (2025-11-03) - Week 2 Backend Deployed + Testing (95% Complete - BLOCKED)**

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ **Backend Test Suite Created**:
  - Created [api/tests/setup.js](api/tests/setup.js) - Test environment configuration
  - Created [api/tests/auth.test.js](api/tests/auth.test.js) - 9 comprehensive auth tests
  - Mocked Prisma Client, Secret Manager, Firebase Admin SDK
  - **All 9/9 tests passing** (locally and in Cloud Shell)
  - Tests cover: register (4), /me (2), logout (2), health (1)
  - Added test scripts to package.json (test, test:watch, test:coverage)

- ✅ **Backend Deployment to Cloud Run**:
  - Dockerized backend with multi-stage build
  - Added health check to Dockerfile
  - Fixed Firebase Admin SDK double initialization bug ([api/middleware/authMiddleware.js](api/middleware/authMiddleware.js:47,61))
  - Changed from `admin.auth()` to `app.auth()` using returned instance
  - Deployed to Cloud Run: cvstomize-api.us-central1.run.app
  - Multiple deployments required due to Docker caching issues
  - Added `ARG CACHEBUST=1` to Dockerfile to force fresh builds

- ✅ **Secret Manager Configuration**:
  - Created `cvstomize-db-url` secret with PostgreSQL connection string
  - Created `cvstomize-project-id` secret (fixed newline issue with `echo -n`)
  - Granted secretAccessor role to compute service account
  - Backend successfully accesses secrets on startup

- ✅ **Cloud SQL Proxy Configuration**:
  - Added `--add-cloudsql-instances="cvstomize:us-central1:cvstomize-db"` to deployment
  - Configured for internal database access (no external IP needed)
  - Cloud Run now has socket access to Cloud SQL

- ✅ **Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed Firebase double initialization (app instance vs global admin)
  - Fixed Secret Manager CONSUMER_INVALID error (newline in project ID)
  - Fixed Docker cache preventing code updates (ARG CACHEBUST)
  - Fixed database connection timeout (5-6 seconds → Cloud SQL Proxy)

**Challenges & Current Blocker:**
- ⚠️ **500 Errors on All Auth Endpoints**:
  - All requests to /api/auth/* return 500 Internal Server Error
  - Firebase initializes successfully: `✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialized successfully`
  - No error details in Cloud Run logs (stdout or stderr)
  - Errors being caught but not logged properly
  - Cannot diagnose root cause without verbose logging

**Error Examples from Browser:**
```
POST /api/auth/register → 401 Unauthorized (expected - no token)
POST /api/auth/register with token → 500 Internal Server Error
GET /api/auth/me → 500 Internal Server Error
POST /api/auth/logout → 500 Internal Server Error
```

**Cloud Run Logs Show:**
```
✅ Firebase Admin SDK initialized successfully
HTTP 500 responses with no error details
Latency: 100-500ms (fast, not timeout related)
```

**Root Cause Theories:**
1. **Database Connection**: Prisma may not be connecting through Cloud SQL Proxy
2. **Error Swallowing**: Error handling middleware may be catching without logging
3. **Prisma Client**: May not be generated correctly in Docker build
4. **Secret Format**: DATABASE_URL may have incorrect format for Cloud SQL Proxy
5. **Socket Path**: Cloud SQL Proxy socket may not be accessible

**Files Modified This Session:**
- [api/tests/setup.js](api/tests/setup.js) - Test configuration
- [api/tests/auth.test.js](api/tests/auth.test.js) - Auth endpoint tests
- [api/jest.config.js](api/jest.config.js) - Jest configuration
- [api/package.json](api/package.json) - Added test scripts
- [api/Dockerfile](api/Dockerfile) - Added ARG CACHEBUST
- [api/middleware/authMiddleware.js](api/middleware/authMiddleware.js) - Fixed Firebase init

**Next Session Debugging Action Plan (Estimated: 2-3 hours):**

1. **Add Verbose Error Logging** (30 mins)
   ```javascript
   // Add to all route handlers in api/routes/auth.js
   try {
     // route logic
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('❌ Error in /api/auth/register:', {
       message: error.message,
       stack: error.stack,
       code: error.code,
       name: error.name
     });
     throw error;
   }
   ```

2. **Create Database Test Endpoint** (15 mins)
   ```javascript
   // Add to api/routes/auth.js or create api/routes/test.js
   router.get('/test/db', async (req, res) => {
     try {
       console.log('🧪 Testing database connection...');
       const result = await prisma.$queryRaw`SELECT 1 as test`;
       console.log('✅ Database connected:', result);
       res.json({ status: 'connected', result });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('❌ Database failed:', error);
       res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Test Minimal Route Without Prisma** (15 mins)
   ```javascript
   // Isolate Firebase vs database issue
   router.get('/test/token', verifyFirebaseToken, (req, res) => {
     console.log('✅ Token verified, user:', req.user);
     res.json({ status: 'success', user: req.user });
   });
   ```

4. **Fix DATABASE_URL Format for Cloud SQL Proxy** (10 mins)
   ```bash
   # CURRENT (incorrect for Cloud SQL Proxy):
   postgresql://cvstomize_app:CVst0mize_App_2025!@34.67.70.34:5432/cvstomize?schema=public

   # SHOULD BE (Unix socket path):
   postgresql://cvstomize_app:CVst0mize_App_2025!@localhost/cvstomize?host=/cloudsql/cvstomize:us-central1:cvstomize-db&schema=public

   # Update secret:
   echo -n "postgresql://cvstomize_app:CVst0mize_App_2025!@localhost/cvstomize?host=/cloudsql/cvstomize:us-central1:cvstomize-db&schema=public" | \
     gcloud secrets versions add cvstomize-db-url --data-file=-
   ```

5. **Verify Prisma Generation** (10 mins)
   ```bash
   # Check latest build logs
   gcloud builds list --limit=1
   gcloud builds log [BUILD_ID] | grep -i "prisma\|error"
   ```

6. **Deploy and Test** (20 mins)
   ```bash
   # Force fresh build
   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/cvstomize/cvstomize-api --build-arg CACHEBUST=$(date +%s)

   # Deploy with Cloud SQL Proxy
   gcloud run deploy cvstomize-api --image gcr.io/cvstomize/cvstomize-api:latest \
     --region us-central1 --platform managed --allow-unauthenticated \
     --add-cloudsql-instances="cvstomize:us-central1:cvstomize-db" \
     --set-secrets="DATABASE_URL=cvstomize-db-url:latest,GCP_PROJECT_ID=cvstomize-project-id:latest"

   # Check logs immediately
   gcloud run services logs read cvstomize-api --limit=50

   # Test endpoints
   curl https://cvstomize-api-351889420459.us-central1.run.app/api/test/db
   ```
