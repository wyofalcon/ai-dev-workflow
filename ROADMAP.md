  - **Solution 3**: Add authorized networks (not recommended)
- ✅ **Migration Strategy**: Vercel site stays live until GCP is 100% ready (zero downtime)

**Next Session Priorities:**
1. ~~Create Express server~~ ✅ DONE
2. ~~Implement Firebase Admin auth middleware~~ ✅ DONE
3. ~~Create auth routes~~ ✅ DONE
4. Set up Cloud SQL Proxy for local testing
5. Test authentication flow with real Firebase tokens
