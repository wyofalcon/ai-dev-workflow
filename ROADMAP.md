## 🎯 Next Session (Session 16): Week 4 - Resume Generation

Now that infrastructure and tests are solid, implement core feature:

### Week 4: Resume Generation ⏳ READY TO START

**Gemini Model Strategy (Production-Ready):**

We have **two Gemini service implementations** ready to use:

1. **geminiService.js** - Direct API (Deprecated 1.5 models)
   - Uses: `gemini-1.5-flash` and `gemini-1.5-pro`
   - Auth: GEMINI_API_KEY
   - Status: ⚠️ Legacy - will be phased out
   - Keep for: Local dev/testing if Vertex fails

2. **geminiServiceVertex.js** - Vertex AI (Production) ✅
   - Uses: `gemini-2.0-flash-001` and `gemini-2.5-pro`
   - Auth: GCP Service Account (already configured)
   - Status: ✅ **PRIMARY** - Production-ready
   - Benefits: Better integration, no API key rotation, GCP billing

**Current Implementation:**
- ✅ **Conversations:** Using `gemini-2.0-flash-001` via Vertex AI
- ✅ **Resume Generation:** Using `gemini-2.5-pro` via Vertex AI
- ✅ Both services already integrated in routes

**Model Selection Rationale:**
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for conversations:
  - Fast response time (~500ms)
  - Cheap (~$0.075 per 1M tokens)
  - Perfect for 6-question personality framework

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for resume generation:
  - Superior quality for complex reasoning
  - Better ATS keyword optimization
  - Worth the cost (~$1.25 per 1M tokens) for final output

**Week 4 Tasks:**
- [x] ✅ Gemini integration (ALREADY DONE via Vertex AI)
- [x] ✅ Enhance resume prompt with personality framing (Phase 1 - 153 lines)
- [x] ✅ Add ATS keyword extraction from job description (Phase 2 - 490 lines)
- [x] ✅ PDF generation with Puppeteer (Phase 3 - 394 lines)
- [x] ✅ Cloud Storage upload (Phase 4 - 281 lines)
- [x] ✅ Download endpoint (Phase 5 - ALREADY COMPLETE)
- [ ] ⏳ Test with 5+ real job descriptions (Phase 6 - IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Add resume quality scoring

**Expected Outcome:** End-to-end resume generation with personality-based framing

---

## 📋 Week 4 Implementation Plan (Detailed)

### Phase 1: Enhanced Resume Prompt (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Upgrade `buildResumePrompt()` to use personality framework

**Tasks:**
1. Read personality profile from database
2. Map Big Five traits to resume writing style:
   - **Openness:** Creative language vs traditional
   - **Conscientiousness:** Detail level and structure
   - **Extraversion:** First-person tone vs third-person
   - **Agreeableness:** Team-focused vs individual achievements
   - **Neuroticism:** Conservative claims vs bold statements

3. Add personality-specific prompt sections:
```javascript
// Example personality mapping
if (profile.openness > 70) {
  prompt += "Use creative, forward-thinking language. Highlight innovation.";
} else {
  prompt += "Use traditional, proven terminology. Highlight reliability.";
}
```

4. Test with 3 different personality profiles on same job

**Files to Modify:**
- `api/services/geminiServiceVertex.js` - Enhance `buildResumePrompt()`
- `api/routes/resume.js` - Pass personality data to service

---

### Phase 2: ATS Keyword Optimization (2 hours)

**Goal:** Extract job description keywords and ensure resume includes them

**Tasks:**
1. Create `extractATSKeywords()` function:
   - Parse job description for skills, tools, certifications
   - Weight keywords by frequency and position
   - Return top 20 keywords with priorities

2. Enhance resume prompt to include:
   - "CRITICAL KEYWORDS TO INCLUDE NATURALLY: [list]"
   - "These keywords must appear at least once in relevant sections"

3. Add post-generation keyword verification:
   - Check if critical keywords are present
   - Generate warning if <80% keyword match

**New File:**
- `api/services/atsOptimizer.js` (150-200 lines)

**Files to Modify:**
- `api/routes/resume.js` - Call ATS optimizer before generation

---

### Phase 3: PDF Generation (3-4 hours)

**Goal:** Convert Markdown resume to professional PDF

**Tasks:**
1. Create `pdfGenerator.js` service:
   - Use Puppeteer to render HTML
   - Apply professional CSS template
   - Support 3 templates: Classic, Modern, Minimal

2. Markdown → HTML conversion:
   - Parse Markdown sections
   - Apply template styling
   - Handle special formatting (bold, italic, lists)

3. PDF optimization:
   - Single page preferred (compact layout)
   - ATS-friendly fonts (Arial, Calibri)
   - No images/graphics (breaks ATS parsing)
   - Export as both PDF and plain text

**New Files:**
- `api/services/pdfGenerator.js` (300-400 lines)
- `api/templates/resume-classic.html` (150 lines)
- `api/templates/resume-modern.html` (150 lines)

**Dependencies Already Installed:**
- ✅ puppeteer (v24.24.0)

---

### Phase 4: Cloud Storage Integration (1-2 hours)

**Goal:** Upload generated PDFs to Cloud Storage

**Tasks:**
1. Configure Cloud Storage bucket permissions:
   - Create `resumes-prod` bucket (if not exists)
   - Set lifecycle: Delete after 90 days
   - Enable signed URLs for downloads

2. Create `storageService.js`:
   - Upload PDF to `resumes/{userId}/{resumeId}.pdf`
   - Generate signed URL (expires in 7 days)
   - Return URL to frontend

3. Update database schema:
   - Add `pdfUrl` field to resumes table
   - Add `expiresAt` timestamp

**Files to Create:**
- `api/services/storageService.js` (100-150 lines)

**Files to Modify:**
- `database/schema.sql` - Add pdfUrl column
- `api/routes/resume.js` - Upload after generation

---

### Phase 5: Download Endpoint (1 hour)

**Goal:** Allow users to download generated resumes

**Tasks:**
1. Create `GET /api/resume/:resumeId/download` endpoint:
   - Verify user owns resume
   - Stream PDF from Cloud Storage
   - Set proper Content-Type headers
   - Track download count

2. Add resume history page:
   - List all user's resumes
   - Show creation date, job title, download link
   - Allow re-download within 7 days

**Files to Modify:**
- `api/routes/resume.js` - Add download endpoint

---

### Phase 6: Testing & Quality (2-3 hours)

**Goal:** Validate resume quality across different inputs

**Test Matrix:**
| Job Type | Personality | Expected Output |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Software Engineer | High Openness | Creative, innovation-focused |
| Accountant | High Conscientiousness | Detail-oriented, traditional |
| Sales Manager | High Extraversion | Results-driven, people-focused |
| Data Analyst | Low Extraversion | Technical, data-focused |
| Teacher | High Agreeableness | Collaborative, student-focused |

**Tasks:**
1. Test with 5 real job descriptions from LinkedIn
2. Verify ATS keyword coverage (>80%)
3. Check PDF formatting on different devices
4. Test download flow end-to-end
5. Load test: 10 concurrent resume generations

**Quality Metrics:**
- Resume generation time: <10 seconds
- PDF size: <500KB
- ATS keyword match: >80%
- User satisfaction survey: >4/5 stars

---

### Phase 7: Outcome Tracking Foundation (1-2 hours)

**Goal:** Build data moat from Day 1 by tracking resume outcomes WITHOUT scope creep

**Why This Matters** (from MONETIZATION_STRATEGY.md):
- Data moat = 20-40x valuation multiplier (vs 5-10x without)
- Foundation for Career Intelligence Platform ($100M+ exit path)
- "Resumes like yours get 2.3x more interviews" messaging
- Enables future marketplace/network effects
- Costs almost nothing now, massive value later

**Database Schema Changes (30 minutes):**
```sql
-- Add outcome tracking to resumes table
ALTER TABLE resumes ADD COLUMN interview_received BOOLEAN DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE resumes ADD COLUMN interview_received_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE resumes ADD COLUMN job_offer_received BOOLEAN DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE resumes ADD COLUMN job_offer_received_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE resumes ADD COLUMN salary_offered DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE resumes ADD COLUMN outcome_reported_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE resumes ADD COLUMN outcome_notes TEXT;

-- Track engagement metrics
ALTER TABLE resumes ADD COLUMN viewed_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE resumes ADD COLUMN shared_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE resumes ADD COLUMN last_viewed_at TIMESTAMP;
```

**API Endpoint (1 hour):**
- `POST /api/resume/:id/report-outcome` - User reports interview/offer
- `GET /api/resume/:id/outcome` - View reported outcome
- Simple, non-intrusive tracking

**Frontend Integration (30 minutes):**
- "Did you get an interview?" prompt 7 days after download
- Optional salary input (for market data)
- Incentive: "Help us help others" + unlock outcome insights

**What This Enables (Future Sessions):**
- Phase 8: Outcome analytics ("Your resume type gets 2.3x more callbacks")
- Phase 9: Personality → Outcome correlation
- Phase 10: Salary insights ("People with your profile earn $120K-150K")
- Year 2-3: Marketplace with proven outcome data

**Metrics to Track:**
- Interview callback rate by personality type
- Salary ranges by role + location
- ATS score → Interview rate correlation
- Resume template → Outcome correlation

**Long-Term Strategy:**
After 10K resumes with outcome data, we have:
- Unbeatable competitive moat (competitors can't replicate data)
- Premium pricing justification ("Proven 2.3x better results")
- Network effects (more data → better predictions)
- B2B licensing opportunity (sell insights to researchers)

**Phase 7 is OPTIONAL for launch but CRITICAL for $100M+ exit path.**
