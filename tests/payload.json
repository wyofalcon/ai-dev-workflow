  "personalStories": "Q1: I've been building web applications for about 4 years. I started with basic HTML/CSS and JavaScript, then learned React and Node.js. I've built several full-stack projects including an e-commerce site and a task management app. I really enjoy creating intuitive user interfaces and solving complex problems with clean code.\n\nQ2: I've worked extensively with PostgreSQL in my personal projects. I designed database schemas for a multi-tenant SaaS application, wrote complex queries with joins and aggregations, and implemented database migrations. I also have some experience with MongoDB for projects that needed flexible schemas.\n\nQ3: I once had to optimize a slow API endpoint that was timing out. I used database query analysis to find N+1 query issues, implemented caching with Redis, and added database indexes. The endpoint went from 8 seconds to under 200ms. It taught me a lot about performance optimization.\n\nQ4: In my last bootcamp project, I led a team of 3 developers building a social media app. I set up the project structure, handled code reviews, and made sure we followed best practices. We used Git for version control and had daily standups. The project was a success and got featured by the bootcamp.\n\nQ5: I love the feeling of solving problems and seeing users actually use what I built. I'm motivated by learning new technologies and improving my craft. I enjoy collaborating with others and learning from more experienced developers. The challenge of turning ideas into working software is what drives me.",
