    "marketing": {
      "q1_experience": "I've led digital marketing campaigns for 6 years across SaaS and e-commerce companies. I managed budgets of $50K-200K/month across Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and LinkedIn. My campaigns consistently achieved 3-5x ROAS through A/B testing and audience segmentation. I'm experienced with both brand awareness and performance marketing.",
      "q2_analytics": "I use Google Analytics daily to track user behavior, conversion funnels, and campaign attribution. I've built custom dashboards in Google Data Studio and use Facebook Pixel for retargeting. I also have experience with Mixpanel and Hotjar for deeper user insights. Data-driven decision making is core to my approach.",
      "q3_team": "I currently manage a team of 3 marketing specialists - one focused on content, one on paid ads, and one on social media. I hold weekly 1-on-1s, set clear OKRs, and foster a collaborative culture. Last year, my team exceeded our lead generation goals by 40% while staying under budget.",
      "q4_campaign": "I launched a multi-channel campaign for a product launch that generated 5,000 qualified leads in 30 days. I coordinated email sequences, social media ads, and influencer partnerships. By optimizing ad creative and targeting, we reduced cost-per-lead by 60% compared to previous campaigns. The campaign directly resulted in $500K in new revenue.",
      "q5_motivation": "I love the creativity and data science blend in marketing. Seeing campaigns go from concept to driving real business results is incredibly rewarding. I'm motivated by challenging goals and continuous learning - the marketing landscape changes fast and I enjoy staying ahead of trends. Building and mentoring teams is also a passion of mine."

    "engineering": {
      "q1_graphql": "I've built GraphQL APIs for two projects in the past year. I designed the schema, implemented resolvers in Node.js, and used Apollo Server. The GraphQL implementation reduced over-fetching and improved mobile app performance by 40% compared to our REST endpoints.",
      "q2_kubernetes": "I've deployed microservices to Kubernetes clusters in AWS EKS. I wrote Helm charts for application deployments and configured auto-scaling based on CPU metrics. I also set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana for our K8s infrastructure.",
      "q3_database": "I optimized a slow PostgreSQL query that was taking 12 seconds down to 200ms. I analyzed the query plan, added composite indexes, and rewrote the query to avoid N+1 issues. I also implemented connection pooling with PgBouncer to handle increased load."
