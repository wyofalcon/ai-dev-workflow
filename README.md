# CVstomize: AI-Powered Resume Tailoring

## 1. My Vision

I built CVstomize to help people like you and me conquer the job application process. My goal is to make it ridiculously easy to tailor your resume for any job you want. No more spending hours manually tweaking your CV for every single application. CVstomize does the heavy lifting for you.

## 2. How It Works

Here's the magic behind CVstomize:

*   **You Bring the Ingredients:** Upload your existing resume, cover letters, or any other documents that showcase your experience. You can also paste your resume text directly.
*   **Tell Me Your Stories:** This is your secret weapon! Share stories about your projects, hobbies, or even that time you won a silly game. My AI will find the hidden skills that make you stand out.
*   **The Target:** Paste the job description for the role you're targeting.
*   **Customize Your Masterpiece:** Choose the sections you want to include in your new, tailored resume. I've pre-selected the most common ones, but you have full control.
*   **Choose Your Style:** Select a style that best represents you.
*   **AI-Powered Generation:** I use the power of Google's Gemini Pro to analyze all your information and generate a brand new, tailored resume that's optimized to beat the Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and impress the hiring managers.
*   **Download and Go:** Your new resume is ready to be downloaded as a PDF, so you can start applying for jobs right away.

## 3. The Tech I Used

I built CVstomize with a modern tech stack to ensure a smooth and reliable experience:

*   **Front-end:** React.js
*   **Back-end:** Node.js Serverless Functions
*   **Deployment & Hosting:** Vercel
*   **AI Engine:** Google Gemini API

## 4. What's Next?

I'm constantly working on improving CVstomize. Here are some of the features I'm planning to add in the near future:

*   More style options
*   Cover letter generation
*   LinkedIn profile optimization
*   And much more!

I'm excited to have you on this journey with me. Let's pwn some ATS!
